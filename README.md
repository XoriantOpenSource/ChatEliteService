##	About ChatElite

ChatElite is a web application that provides peer-to-peer and group chat. ChatElite is developed using Node.js and Mongo DB for database. ChatElite can be used as pluggable chat tool by using collapsed mode. This mode can be used to integrate ChatElite with another web-based application.
